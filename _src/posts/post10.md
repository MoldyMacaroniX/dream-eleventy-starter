I'm really more an apartment person. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Keep your mind limber.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. You look…perfect. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I have a dark side, too. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I like seafood. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

Keep your mind limber. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

1. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.
2. You all right, Dexter?
3. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

Makes me a … scientist. Makes me a … scientist. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Makes me a … scientist.

* Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.
* This man is a knight in shining armor.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I have a dark side, too. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Cops, another community I'm not part of. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Makes me a … scientist. I'm generally confused most of the time. Makes me a … scientist.

You're a killer. I catch killers. You all right, Dexter? I'm really more an apartment person. You're a killer. I catch killers. You look…perfect.

God created pudding, and then he rested. I am not a killer. I'm partial to air conditioning. I am not a killer. I have a dark side, too.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Only you could make those words cute.

I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm really more an apartment person. Only you could make those words cute. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Like a sloth. I can do that.

I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! This man is a knight in shining armor.
