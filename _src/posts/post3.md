Cops, another community I'm not part of. I am not a killer. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Watching ice melt. This is fun. He taught me a code. To survive.

This man is a knight in shining armor. God created pudding, and then he rested. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Like a sloth. I can do that.

Makes me a … scientist. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? God created pudding, and then he rested. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I have a dark side, too.

I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm really more an apartment person. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. This man is a knight in shining armor.

I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! You look…perfect. I'm really more an apartment person.

1. You look…perfect.
2. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.
3. Makes me a … scientist.

I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm generally confused most of the time.

You're a killer. I catch killers. Tell him time is of the essence. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm partial to air conditioning.

* I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
* I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
* Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Makes me a … scientist. You're a killer. I catch killers. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Tell him time is of the essence. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You look…perfect. I'm generally confused most of the time. This man is a knight in shining armor.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Only you could make those words cute. I'm really more an apartment person.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Keep your mind limber. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm partial to air conditioning.
