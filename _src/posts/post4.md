Makes me a … scientist. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm partial to air conditioning. He taught me a code. To survive.

He taught me a code. To survive. Keep your mind limber. He taught me a code. To survive. Like a sloth. I can do that. Keep your mind limber.

I like seafood. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

Like a sloth. I can do that. Makes me a … scientist. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. He taught me a code. To survive. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

1. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.
2. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.
3. Only you could make those words cute.

I have a dark side, too. Only you could make those words cute. You all right, Dexter? Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. You look…perfect. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm really more an apartment person. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. He taught me a code. To survive.

* Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.
* I have a dark side, too.
* I have a dark side, too.

He taught me a code. To survive. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm really more an apartment person. You look…perfect.

You look…perfect. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! God created pudding, and then he rested. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. You all right, Dexter?

Only you could make those words cute. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Keep your mind limber. This man is a knight in shining armor.

Keep your mind limber. God created pudding, and then he rested. Hello, Dexter Morgan. God created pudding, and then he rested.

I'm really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

You're a killer. I catch killers. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.
