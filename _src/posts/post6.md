Hello, Dexter Morgan. This man is a knight in shining armor. God created pudding, and then he rested. Makes me a … scientist.

Cops, another community I'm not part of. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Tell him time is of the essence. You look…perfect. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm really more an apartment person. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Makes me a … scientist. Only you could make those words cute. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. This man is a knight in shining armor. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

* Like a sloth. I can do that.
* I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.
* I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

I have a dark side, too. Makes me a … scientist. He taught me a code. To survive. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Like a sloth. I can do that.

You look…perfect. Keep your mind limber. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.

Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I am not a killer. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I am not a killer.

This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm really more an apartment person.

I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm generally confused most of the time. Tell him time is of the essence.

I'm really more an apartment person. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. You all right, Dexter? Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?

I like seafood. Only you could make those words cute. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I have a dark side, too. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?
