I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. This man is a knight in shining armor.

I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm generally confused most of the time. Makes me a … scientist. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.

I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.

I'm really more an apartment person. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Hello, Dexter Morgan.

1. Cops, another community I'm not part of.
2. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

He taught me a code. To survive. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I have a dark side, too. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. You all right, Dexter? I am not a killer.

* You all right, Dexter?
* Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.
* God created pudding, and then he rested.

Keep your mind limber. I am not a killer. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? You look…perfect.

I'm partial to air conditioning. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I have a dark side, too. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm partial to air conditioning. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

You're a killer. I catch killers. I like seafood. You all right, Dexter? This man is a knight in shining armor. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

I am not a killer. I like seafood. Like a sloth. I can do that. Makes me a … scientist.

I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Like a sloth. I can do that. Makes me a … scientist.

You look…perfect. Only you could make those words cute. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.
